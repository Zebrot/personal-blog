-- **There is something naive about starting a blog in 2025, don't you think ?** --

Blogs haven't been the shiny new things for around a decade, but they're still a way for developpers or niche hobbyists to share their thoughts, their tutorials... I myself have spent hours reading blog posts from developpers, looking for information or insight, so building my own blog was a natural way for me to give back.
