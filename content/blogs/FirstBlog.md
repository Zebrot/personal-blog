-- **There is something naive about starting a blog in 2025, don't you think ?** --

I mean, blogs have been culturally outdated for around a decade at this point, and with AI slop running around everywhere it feels like both writing and web development have been made obsolete as well. Well then, consider this *vintage*, *old-shool*. Or better yet, consider it *absurd*.I don't write here because I think it's gonna make a difference, or because I gain anything from it, I do it because creating websites and writing are the two things that I can do for more than 2 hours straight without getting bored.


Maybe I'm creating this blog because what I have to say is of utmost, life-saving value to the world
[lien](google.com)
Maybe I do it because I want to teach myself NextJs, and I'm using this as a pretext to code and write (yes, it's that one)

Maybe I do it *because* of how useless it is, in a crazy bout of absurdist heroism 


-- Anyways, I'm doing it ! --

## Absurdism

Oh yeah, there's a third thing I can do for hours without getting bored : **Philosophy**.
And in terms of philosophy, there is one man who has had such a profound impact on my life that I almost considered myself a disciple before remembering how stupid philosophy schools are. This man, Albert Camus, is not even considered one of the *good* philosophers. He's the 3rd one in the trio of Jean-Paul Sartres (the good philosopher, if you ask pompous self-centered philosophers), Simone de Beauvoir (the actual good philosopher, if you ask anyone else), and well Albert Camus, the guy most famous for writing fiction, who also wrote one book that absolutely changed me : The Myth of Sisyphus. 


Any book that starts with "the only important question is the question of suicide", and ends with "one must imagine Sisyphus happy" promises an adventure : to anyone who wonders why or how life is worth living, Camus delivers a deeply touching and actionnable answer. An answer that I won't reveal in here (it would be like spoiling a good mystery novel), but an answer that you can apply to your life, starting today, and I would argue improve your life. An answer that stops you looking for the perfect opportunity, or the most complete understanding, an answer to the life's greatest mysteries that honestly doesn't even bother with life's greatest mysteries. Because they don't exactly matter if we're being honest. 


-- In the end, what matters is that I, you, we , **do** things. Good things if possible, but for starters, just things. --

## Next.Js

I just love that the two first chapters of this blog are **absurdism** and **nextJs**.
